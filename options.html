    <p><b>Aggressive mode looks for a broader range of sensitive words. It might hide content that are not COVID related.</b></p>
    <p>This app is very minimal. I made it for people around me who needed it, but it is near from perfect.</p>
    <p>I'd be happy to improve the app, so if you actually find it useful please let me know by leaving a review - thank you.</p>
    <p><b>Hope this extension will help you stay in a calmer mood. Stay safe and enjoy life!</b></p>
